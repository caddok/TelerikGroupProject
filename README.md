What is our project about?

A line-of-business application:

We've built and implemented the structure of an online store. We've used the core principles of the Object-oriented programming
and the best practices for Object-oriented design to build our project. We've divided our structure in layers:

 - Product database

 - Business logic
 
 - Presenter

 - Chat bot for user interaction


We've combined all this layers together using composition in conjunction with 
abstract classes and interfaces to deliver the required user experience and interaction with the store.
 
 
 Main features of our store:
-	log in
-	list all products
-	sort by price ascending  / descending  ,  by category  ,  by name 
-	search products  by name, brand, category, below given price, above given price or description
-	customize products
-	add products to your shopping  cart
-	discount options depending on your user status
-	order items in your shopping cart 
-	show order details
