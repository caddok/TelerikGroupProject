What is our project about?

We've build and implemented the structure of an online store. We used the core principles of the Object-oriented programming
and the best practices for Object-oriented design to build our project. We used composition in conjunction with abstract classes
and interfaces to deliver the requiered user experience and interaction with the store.
 
If you want to see our project you can go at https://github.com/caddok/TelerikGroupProject
There you will find the full source code and all the required assets to execute it.
