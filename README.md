What is our project about?

A line-of-business application:

We've build and implemented the structure of an online store. We used the core principles of the Object-oriented programming
and the best practices for Object-oriented design to build our project. We've divided our structure in layers:

 - Product database

 - Bussiness logic
 
 - Presenter

 - Chat bot for user interaction


We've build and implemented the structure of an online store. We used the core principles of the Object-oriented programming
and the best practices for Object-oriented design to build our project. We've combined all this layers together using composition in conjunction with 
abstract classes and interfaces to deliver the requiered user experience and interaction with the store.
